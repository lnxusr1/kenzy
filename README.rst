===============================================================================================

This project is dedicated to building a “Synthetic Human” which is
called Kenzy for which we have assigned the female gender pronoun of
“she”. She has visual face recognition
(`opencv/opencv <https://github.com/opencv/opencv>`__), speech
transcription (`coqui <https://github.com/coqui-ai>`__), and speech
synthesis (`festival <http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>`__ or
`mimic3 <https://github.com/MycroftAI/mimic3>`__). Kenzy is written in
Python and is targeted primarily at the single board computer (SBC)
platforms like the `Raspberry Pi <https://www.raspberrypi.org/>`__.
